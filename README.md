# portfo
#I built a portfolio website for this project. 
The server is written in python using the Flask framework and hosted on PythonAnywhere.
The website has a submit message functionality that allows sent messages to be stored in a csv file that acts as a database.
It also has a link to my Twitter and Github handles via the respective buttons.
